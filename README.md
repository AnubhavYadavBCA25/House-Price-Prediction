# House Price Prediction Project

## General Structure of this Project
- Title: House Price Prediction
- Description: The "House Price Prediction Project" leverages machine learning techniques to predict the sale prices of houses in King County, USA. Utilizing the "House Sales in King County" dataset, which contains detailed information on home sales from May 2014 to May 2015, the project aims to develop an accurate model that can estimate house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location.

### About the Dataset
- Source of Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction
- Context: The "House Sales in King County, USA" dataset provides comprehensive information on home sales in King County, which includes Seattle, from May 2014 to May 2015. The dataset consists of 21,613 records, each containing various features that describe the properties, such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, lot size, year built, and geographic location. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for building predictive models to estimate house prices based on these features, offering insights into the factors that influence real estate values in the region.
- Key features include:
    - Price: The sale price of the house.
    - Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms.
    - Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms.
    - Sqft_living: Square footage of the living space.
    - Sqft_lot: Square footage of the lot.
    - Floors: Number of floors in the house.
    - Waterfront: A binary variable indicating if the house has a waterfront view.
    - View: An index from 0 to 4 of how good the view of the property was.
    - Condition: An index from 1 to 5 on the condition of the house.
    - Grade: An index from 1 to 13, where 1-3 falls short of building construction and design, 7 has an average level of construction and design, and 11-13 have a high-quality level of construction and design.
    - Sqft_above: Square footage of the house apart from the basement.
    - Sqft_basement: Square footage of the basement.
    - Year_built: The year the house was originally built.
    - Year_renovated: The year the house was last renovated.
    - Zipcode: The ZIP code in which the house is located.
    - Latitude and Longitude: Geographical coordinates of the house.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices in King County, USA, based on various property features. By analyzing and leveraging the "House Sales in King County" dataset, the project aims to identify key factors influencing home values and provide a reliable tool for estimating market prices.
