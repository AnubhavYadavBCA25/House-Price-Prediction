             many factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc. Predicting the price of a house is 
             a challenging task due to the complexity of the real estate market. In this project, we will use machine learning 
             algorithms to predict the price of a house based on its features.''')

    st.write("""
    1. Data Collection: The first step is to collect the data. We will use the Boston Housing dataset for this project.
    2. Data Preprocessing: The next step is to preprocess the data. We will clean the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.
    3. Exploratory Data Analysis: We will perform exploratory data analysis to understand the data and identify patterns.
    4. Feature Engineering: We will create new features from the existing features to improve the performance of the model.
    5. Model Building: We will build a machine learning model to predict the price of a house.
    6. Model Evaluation: We will evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics.
    7. Selection of the Best Model: We will select the best model based on the evaluation metrics.
    8. Deployment: We will deploy the model as a web application using Streamlit.
    9. Prediction: Users can input the features of a house and get the predicted price of the house.
    10. Data Storage: We will store the data in a database for future use.
    11. Feedback: Users can provide feedback on the predictions.
